# Newsletter
Main aim of this project is to create python script which will send emails with attachments to people who are signed to newsletter.

The following assumptions were created:
- We have csv file with emails and names people who are signed to newsletter,
- We want to use receiver's name in mail,
- We want to sometimes add attachment or attachments (but not always)
- Each attachment can be picture or pdf file
- Body of mail is prepared as docx file which can contain bold or italic text
